#This is a Python Code
#I use this code for analysing thousands of TLDs. 
#I group the TLDs by wearer to find their annual dose, and then group by profession, body part and dose.
#This way we can analyse how many wearers got each dose value.
#This code was used to do data analysis for the upcoming UKHSA report on radiation received by radiation workers.
